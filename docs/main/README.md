# Orchestrator Documentation

For comprehensive documentation on the Orchestrator, please visit [https://www.rhdhorchestrator.io](https://www.rhdhorchestrator.io).

## Installing the Orchestrator Helm Operator

Deploy the Orchestrator solution suite in an OCP cluster using the Orchestrator operator.\
The operator installs the following components onto the target OpenShift cluster:

- RHDH (Red Hat Developer Hub) Backstage
- OpenShift Serverless Logic Operator (with Data-Index and Job Service)
- OpenShift Serverless Operator
  - Knative Eventing
  - Knative Serving
- (Optional) An ArgoCD project named `orchestrator`. Requires an pre-installed ArgoCD/OpenShift GitOps instance in the cluster. Disabled by default
- (Optional) Tekton tasks and build pipeline. Requires an pre-installed Tekton/OpenShift Pipelines instance in the cluster. Disabled by default

## Important Note for ARM64 Architecture Users

Note that as of November 6, 2023, OpenShift Serverless Operator is based on RHEL 8 images which are not supported on the ARM64 architecture. Consequently, deployment of this operator on an [OpenShift Local](https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/install-openshift-local) cluster on MacBook laptops with M1/M2 chips is not supported.

## Prerequisites

- Logged in to a Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform (version 4.13+) cluster as a cluster administrator.
- [OpenShift CLI (oc)](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.13/cli_reference/openshift_cli/getting-started-cli.html) is installed.
- [Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM)](https://olm.operatorframework.io/docs/getting-started/) has been installed in your cluster.
- Your cluster has a [default storage class](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.13/storage/container_storage_interface/persistent-storage-csi-sc-manage.html) provisioned.
- A GitHub API Token - to import items into the catalog, ensure you have a `GITHUB_TOKEN` with the necessary permissions as detailed [here](https://backstage.io/docs/integrations/github/locations/).
  -  For classic token, include the following permissions:
      - repo (all)
      - admin:org (read:org)
      - user (read:user, user:email)
      - workflow (all) - required for using the software templates for creating workflows in GitHub
  - For Fine grained token:
      - Repository permissions: **Read** access to metadata, **Read** and **Write** access to actions, actions variables, administration, code, codespaces, commit statuses, environments, issues, pull requests, repository hooks, secrets, security events, and workflows.
      - Organization permissions: **Read** access to members, **Read** and **Write** access to organization administration, organization hooks, organization projects, and organization secrets.

><font color="red">⚠️**Warning**:</font> Skipping these steps will prevent the Orchestrator from functioning properly.

### Deployment with GitOps

  If you plan to deploy in a GitOps environment, make sure you have installed the `ArgoCD/Red Hat OpenShift GitOps` and the `Tekton/Red Hat Openshift Pipelines Install` operators following these [instructions](https://github.com/rhdhorchestrator/orchestrator-helm-operator/blob/main/docs/gitops/README.md).
  The Orchestrator installs RHDH and imports software templates designed for bootstrapping workflow development. These templates are crafted to ease the development lifecycle, including a Tekton pipeline to build workflow images and generate workflow K8s custom resources. Furthermore, ArgoCD is utilized to monitor any changes made to the workflow repository and to automatically trigger the Tekton pipelines as needed.

- `ArgoCD/OpenShift GitOps` operator
  - Ensure at least one instance of `ArgoCD` exists in the designated namespace (referenced by `ARGOCD_NAMESPACE` environment variable). Example [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rhdhorchestrator/orchestrator-helm-operator/main/docs/gitops/resources/argocd-example.yaml)
  - Validated API is `argoproj.io/v1alpha1/AppProject`
- `Tekton/OpenShift Pipelines` operator
  - Validated APIs are `tekton.dev/v1beta1/Task` and `tekton.dev/v1/Pipeline`
  - Requires ArgoCD installed since the manifests are deployed in the same namespace as the ArgoCD instance.

  Remember to enable [argocd](https://github.com/rhdhorchestrator/orchestrator-helm-operator/blob/c577e95e063e2bf8119b2b23890df04792f9424c/config/crd/bases/rhdh.redhat.com_orchestrators.yaml#L451) and [tekton](https://github.com/rhdhorchestrator/orchestrator-helm-operator/blob/c577e95e063e2bf8119b2b23890df04792f9424c/config/crd/bases/rhdh.redhat.com_orchestrators.yaml#L443) in your CR instance.

## Detailed Installation Guide
### From OperatorHub
1. Deploying PostgreSQL reference implementation
   - **If you do not have a PostgreSQL instance in your cluster** \
   you can deploy the PostgreSQL reference implementation by following the steps [here](https://github.com/rhdhorchestrator/orchestrator-helm-operator/blob/main/docs/postgresql/README.md).
   - **If you already have PostgreSQL running in your cluster** \
   ensure that the default settings in the [PostgreSQL values](https://github.com/rhdhorchestrator/orchestrator-helm-chart/blob/main/postgresql/values.yaml) file match those provided in the [Orchestrator values](https://github.com/rhdhorchestrator/orchestrator-helm-operator/blob/main/helm-charts/orchestrator/values.yaml) file.
1. Install Orchestrator operator
   1. Go to OperatorHub in your OpenShift Console.
   1. Search for and install the Orchestrator Operator.
1.  Run the Setup Script
    1. Follow the steps in the [Running the Setup Script](#running-the-setup-script) section to download and execute the setup.sh script, which initializes the RHDH environment.
1. Create an Orchestrator instance
   1. Once the Orchestrator Operator is installed, navigate to Installed Operators.
   1. Select Orchestrator Operator.
   1. Click on Create Instance to deploy an Orchestrator instance.
1. Verify resources and wait until they are running
   1. From console run the following command get the necessary wait commands: \
      `oc describe orchestrator orchestrator-sample -n openshift-operators | grep -A 10 "Run the following commands to wait until the services are ready:"`\

      The command will return an output similar to the one below, which lists several oc wait commands. This depends on your specific cluster.
      ```bash
        oc wait -n openshift-serverless deploy/knative-openshift --for=condition=Available --timeout=5m
        oc wait -n knative-eventing knativeeventing/knative-eventing --for=condition=Ready --timeout=5m
        oc wait -n knative-serving knativeserving/knative-serving --for=condition=Ready --timeout=5m
        oc wait -n openshift-serverless-logic deploy/logic-operator-rhel8-controller-manager --for=condition=Available --timeout=5m
        oc wait -n sonataflow-infra sonataflowplatform/sonataflow-platform --for=condition=Succeed --timeout=5m
        oc wait -n sonataflow-infra deploy/sonataflow-platform-data-index-service --for=condition=Available --timeout=5m
        oc wait -n sonataflow-infra deploy/sonataflow-platform-jobs-service --for=condition=Available --timeout=5m
        oc get networkpolicy -n sonataflow-infra
        ```
   1. Copy and execute each command from the output in your terminal. These commands ensure that all necessary services and resources in your OpenShift environment are available and running correctly.
   1. If any service does not become available, verify the logs for that service or consult [troubleshooting steps](https://www.rhdhorchestrator.io/main/docs/serverless-workflows/troubleshooting/).

### Manual Install
1. Deploy the PostgreSQL reference implementation for persistence support in SonataFlow following these [instructions](https://github.com/rhdhorchestrator/orchestrator-helm-operator/blob/main/docs/postgresql/README.md)

1. Create a namespace for the Orchestrator solution:

   ```console
   oc new-project orchestrator
   ```

1.  Run the Setup Script
    1. Follow the steps in the [Running the Setup Script](#running-the-setup-script) section to download and execute the setup.sh script, which initializes the RHDH environment.

1.  Use the following manifest to install the operator in an OCP cluster:

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1
    kind: Subscription
    metadata:
      name: orchestrator-operator
      namespace: openshift-operators
    spec:
      channel: stable
      installPlanApproval: Automatic
      name: orchestrator-operator
      source: redhat-operators
      sourceNamespace: openshift-marketplace
    ```

1.  Run the following commands to determine when the installation is completed:

    ```console
    wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rhdhorchestrator/orchestrator-helm-operator/main/hack/wait_for_operator_installed.sh -O /tmp/wait_for_operator_installed.sh && chmod u+x /tmp/wait_for_operator_installed.sh && /tmp/wait_for_operator_installed.sh
    ```

    During the installation process, Kubernetes cronjobs are created by the operator to monitor the lifecycle of the CRs managed by the operator: RHDH operator, OpenShift Serverless operator and OpenShift Serverless Logic operator. When deleting one of the previously mentioned CRs, a job is triggered that ensures the CR is removed before the operator is.
    In case of any failure at this stage, these jobs remain active, facilitating administrators in retrieving detailed diagnostic information to identify and address the cause of the failure.

    > **Note:** that every minute on the clock a job is triggered to reconcile the CRs with the orchestrator resource values. These cronjobs are deleted when their respective features (e.g. `rhdhOperator.enabled=false`) are removed or when the orchestrator resource is removed. This is required because the CRs are not managed by helm due to the CRD dependency pre availability to the deployment of the CR.

1. Apply the Orchestrator custom resource (CR) on the cluster to create an instance of RHDH and resources of OpenShift Serverless Operator and OpenShift Serverless Operator Logic.
   Make any changes to the [CR](https://github.com/rhdhorchestrator/orchestrator-helm-operator/blob/main/config/samples/_v1alpha2_orchestrator.yaml) before applying it, or test the default Orchestrator CR:
    ```console
    oc apply -n orchestrator -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rhdhorchestrator/orchestrator-helm-operator/refs/heads/main/config/samples/_v1alpha2_orchestrator.yaml
    ```

### Running The Setup Script
The setup.sh script simplifies the initialization of the RHDH environment by creating the required authentication secret and labeling GitOps namespaces based on the cluster configuration.


1. Create a namespace for the RHDH instance. This namespace is predefined as the default in both the setup.sh script and the Orchestrator CR but can be overridden if needed.

   ```console
   oc new-project rhdh-operator
   ```

1. Download the setup script from the github repository and run it to create the RHDH secret and label the GitOps namespaces:

   ```console
   wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rhdhorchestrator/orchestrator-helm-operator/release-1.3/hack/setup.sh -O /tmp/setup.sh && chmod u+x /tmp/setup.sh
   ```

1. Run the script:
   ```console
   /tmp/setup.sh --use-default
   ```

**NOTE:** If you don't want to use the default values, omit the `--use-default` and the script will prompt you for input.

The contents will vary depending on the configuration in the cluster. The following list details all the keys that can appear in the secret:

> - `BACKEND_SECRET`: Value is randomly generated at script execution. This is the only mandatory key required to be in the secret for the RHDH Operator to start.
> - `K8S_CLUSTER_URL`: The URL of the Kubernetes cluster is obtained dynamically using `oc whoami --show-server`.
> - `K8S_CLUSTER_TOKEN`: The value is obtained dynamically based on the provided namespace and service account.
> - `GITHUB_TOKEN`: This value is prompted from the user during script execution and is not predefined.
> - `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` and `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET`: The value for both these fields are used to authenticate against GitHub. For more information open this [link](https://backstage.io/docs/auth/github/provider/).
> - `ARGOCD_URL`: This value is dynamically obtained based on the first ArgoCD instance available.
> - `ARGOCD_USERNAME`: Default value is set to `admin`.
> - `ARGOCD_PASSWORD`: This value is dynamically obtained based on the first ArgoCD instance available.

Keys will not be added to the secret if they have no values associated. So for instance, when deploying in a cluster without the GitOps operators, the `ARGOCD_URL`, `ARGOCD_USERNAME` and `ARGOCD_PASSWORD` keys will be omited in the secret.

Sample of a secret created in a GitOps environment:

```console
$> oc get secret -n rhdh-operator -o yaml backstage-backend-auth-secret
apiVersion: v1
data:
  ARGOCD_PASSWORD: ...
  ARGOCD_URL: ...
  ARGOCD_USERNAME: ...
  BACKEND_SECRET: ...
  GITHUB_TOKEN: ...
  K8S_CLUSTER_TOKEN: ...
  K8S_CLUSTER_URL: ...
kind: Secret
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: "2024-05-07T22:22:59Z"
  name: backstage-backend-auth-secret
  namespace: rhdh-operator
  resourceVersion: "4402773"
  uid: 2042e741-346e-4f0e-9d15-1b5492bb9916
type: Opaque
```

### Enabling Monitoring for Workflows
If you want to enable monitoring for workflows, you shall enable it in the `Orchestrator` CR as follows:

```yaml
apiVersion: rhdh.redhat.com/v1alpha2
kind: Orchestrator
metadata:
  name: ...
spec:
  ...
  orchestrator:
    ...
    sonataflowPlatform:
      monitoring:
        enabled: true
      ...
```

After the CR is deployed, follow the [instructions](https://sonataflow.org/serverlessworkflow/main/cloud/operator/monitoring-workflows.html) to deploy Prometheus, Grafana and the sample Grafana dashboard. 

### Using Knative eventing communication
If you want to use a Knative broker for communication between the different componenets (Data Index, Job Service and Workflows), you should use a broker.

Kafka is a good candiate as it fullfills the reliability need. You can find the list of availables brokers for Knative is here: https://knative.dev/docs/eventing/brokers/broker-types/

You could also use an in-memory broker but you should not use it for production purposes.

Follow these [instructions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rhdhorchestrator/orchestrator-helm-operator/refs/heads/main/docs/main/eventing-communication/README.md) to setup the Knative broker communication.

## Additional information

### Additional Workflow Namespaces

When deploying a workflow in a namespace different from where Sonataflow services are running (e.g., sonataflow-infra), several essential steps must be followed:

1. **Label the Workflow Namespace:**
  To allow Sonataflow services to accept traffic from workflows, apply the following label to the desired workflow namespace:
   ```console
      oc label ns $ADDITIONAL_NAMESPACE rhdh.redhat.com/workflow-namespace=""
   ```
2. **Identify the RHDH Namespace:**
   Retrieve the namespace where RHDH is running by executing:
   ```console
      oc get backstage -A
   ```
   Store the namespace value in RHDH_NAMESPACE in the Network Policy manifest below.
3. **Identify the Sonataflow Services Namespace:**
   Check the namespace where Sonataflow services are deployed:
   ```console
      oc get sonataflowclusterplatform -A
   ```
   If there is no cluster platform, check for a namespace-specific platform:
   ```console
      oc get sonataflowplatform -A
   ```
   Store the namespace value in SONATAFLOW_PLATFORM_NAMESPACE.

4. **Set Up a Network Policy:**
   Configure a network policy to allow traffic only between RHDH, Sonataflow services, and the workflows. The policy can be derived from [here](https://github.com/rhdhorchestrator/orchestrator-helm-operator/blob/main/helm-charts/orchestrator/templates/network-policies.yaml)

   ```console
   oc create -f - <<EOF
   apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
   kind: NetworkPolicy
   metadata:
     name: allow-rhdh-to-sonataflow-and-workflows
     # Sonataflow and Workflows are using the same namespace.
     namespace: $ADDITIONAL_NAMESPACE
   spec:
     podSelector: {}
     ingress:
       - from:
         - namespaceSelector:
             matchLabels:
               # Allow RHDH namespace to communicate with workflows.
               kubernetes.io/metadata.name: $RHDH_NAMESPACE
         - namespaceSelector:
             matchLabels:
               # Allow Sonataflow services to communicate with workflows.
               kubernetes.io/metadata.name: $SONATAFLOW_PLATFORM_NAMESPACE
   EOF
   ```
5. **Ensure Persistence for the Workflow:**
  If persistence is required, follow these steps:
  * **Create a PostgreSQL Secret:**
    The workflow needs its own schema in PostgreSQL. Create a secret containing the PostgreSQL credentials in the workflow's namespace:
    ```
    oc get secret sonataflow-psql-postgresql -n sonataflow-infra -o yaml > secret.yaml
    sed -i '/namespace: sonataflow-infra/d' secret.yaml
    oc apply -f secret.yaml -n $ADDITIONAL_NAMESPACE
    ```
  * **Configure the Namespace Attribute:**
    Add the namespace attribute under the `serviceRef` property where the PostgreSQL server is deployed.
    ```yaml
    apiVersion: sonataflow.org/v1alpha08
    kind: SonataFlow
      ...
    spec:
      ...
      persistence:
        postgresql:
          secretRef:
            name: sonataflow-psql-postgresql
            passwordKey: postgres-password
            userKey: postgres-username
          serviceRef:
            databaseName: sonataflow
            databaseSchema: greeting
            name: sonataflow-psql-postgresql
            namespace: $POSTGRESQL_NAMESPACE
            port: 5432
    ```
    Replace POSTGRESQL_NAMESPACE with the namespace where the PostgreSQL server is deployed.

By following these steps, the workflow will have the necessary credentials to access PostgreSQL and will correctly reference the service in a different namespace.

### GitOps environment

See the dedicated [document](https://github.com/rhdhorchestrator/orchestrator-helm-operator/blob/main/docs/gitops/README.md)

### Deploying PostgreSQL reference implementation

See [here](https://github.com/rhdhorchestrator/orchestrator-helm-operator/blob/main/docs/postgresql/README.md)

### ArgoCD and workflow namespace

If you manually created the workflow namespaces (e.g., `$WORKFLOW_NAMESPACE`), run this command to add the required label that allows ArgoCD to deploy instances there:

```console
oc label ns $WORKFLOW_NAMESPACE argocd.argoproj.io/managed-by=$ARGOCD_NAMESPACE
```

### Workflow installation

Follow [Workflows Installation](https://www.rhdhorchestrator.io/serverless-workflows-config/)

## Cleanup

**\/!\\ Before removing the orchestrator, make sure you have first removed any installed workflows. Otherwise the deletion may become hung in a terminating state.**

To remove the operator from the cluster, delete the subscription:

```console
oc delete subscriptions.operators.coreos.com orchestrator-operator -n openshift-operators
```

Note that the CRDs created during the installation process will remain in the cluster.

To clean the rest of the resources, run:
```console
oc get crd -o name | grep -e sonataflow -e rhdh | xargs oc delete
oc delete namespace orchestrator sonataflow-infra rhdh-operator
```

If you want to remove *knative* related resources, you may also run:
```console
oc get crd -o name | grep -e knative | xargs oc delete
```
